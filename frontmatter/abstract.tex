This thesis embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a cornerstone problem in the field of computational optimization, known for its straightforward premise yet complex resolution. At the core of this investigation lies a dual objective: to dissect the intricate nature of TSP through various algorithmic lenses and to introduce a novel variant of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique, termed the Red-Black Ant Colony System, aimed at enhancing solution efficiency and accuracy.
